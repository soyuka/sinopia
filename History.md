13 Mar 2014, version 0.7.0

- config changes:
  - breaking change: all time intervals are now specified in *seconds* instead of *milliseconds* for the sake of consistency. Change `timeout` if you have one!
  - all time intervals now can be specified in [nginx notation](http://wiki.nginx.org/ConfigNotation), for example `1m 30s` will specify a 90 seconds timeout
  - added `maxage` option to avoid asking public registry for the same data too often (issue #47)
  - added `max_fails` and `fail_timeout` options to reduce amount of requests to public registry when it's down (issue #7)

- bug fixes:
  - fix crash when headers are sent twice (issue #52)
  - all tarballs are returned with `Content-Length`, which allows [yapm](https://github.com/rlidwka/yapm) to estimate download time
  - when connection to public registry is interrupted when downloading a tarball, we no longer save incomplete tarball to the disk
